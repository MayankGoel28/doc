The Global WordNet Association (GWA) is a free, public and
non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing,
sharing and connecting semantic lexicons (wordnets) for all languages
in the world.  Our goal is to make compatible, linked, open lexical
resources useful for both humans and computers. As an example,
<a href="http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/cgi-bin/wn-gridx.cgi?usrname=&gridmode=grid&synset=06639428-n&lang=eng&lang2=eng">here</a>
is the entry for <em>wordnet</em> in the Open Multilingual Wordnet
(OMW 1.0) and in
the <a href='https://www.luismc.com/omw/omw/concepts/57603'>development
branch of OMW 2.0</a>.
</p>

<p>The English Wordnet is extremely widely used, and so is the
  multilingual data from the OMW 1.0, which is distributed with the
  Python <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</a>, used by Google Translate, Babelnet
  and many more.  The documentation we are building here is aiming at
  the new version (OMW 2.0) which makes the semantic network less
  biased towards English.   We have high quality contributions for
  over 40 languages (not all on the website yet).</p>

<p>We are eager to welcome tech writing collaborators through the
  Google Season of Docs program to help us with our documentation
  needs!  GWA is a collaboration of many projects.  We have
  selected three for this proposal, and the application has been
  blessed by the GWA board (five members of which are involved in the proposal).</p>

<p align='center'>We have
  been <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants">selected
  to participate in 2020</a>!</p>

</a>

<h2>Ideas we invite tech writers to work with us on:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#structure">Wordnet Structure</a>: what do the parts of
    a lexical entry mean?
    <br>Ideally this should include documentation accessible to users of the
    lexicons as well as developers.



  <li> <a href="#omw">The Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW)</a>:
    <br>Some how-tos:
  <ul>
  <li> how to look up words and concepts
  <li> how to add a new wordnet project
  <li> how to download data
</ul>

<li><a href="#contrib">How to contribute a word or concept to a
wordnet</a>:
<ul>
  <li> Minimal required information
  <li> Desired information
  <li> Structure of definitions
</ul>
</ul>

<p>These tasks should all start with a documentation audit, to
  see what we do and don't have already.

<h2>Detailed Descriptions:</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Project name: <a name="structure">Wordnet Structure</a></h3>

<br>

<a href="http://globalwordnet.org/">
  <img src="pics/GWA_logo.png", style="height:10ex;float:left;padding-right: 10px">
</a>

<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1.1em">The goal is to make sure all the data-types (semantic relations,
  parts-of-speech, verb patterns, ...) are properly documented.  The
  goal is that both dictionary users and dictionary developers can
  access this easily, and we have a procedure for adding more
  documentation as needed.

  <br>

<h4>Description</h4>


<p>We have started to make a central repository of
  documentation for, e.g., semantic relations: <a href="https://globalwordnet.github.io/gwadoc/">gwadoc</a>,
  but it needs a lot of work.  We are trying to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">UX</a> strings together with the documentation,
  to make it easier to keep them in sync.

<p>The goal is to have the documentation dynamically produced with the
  lexicons, so that we know we always have the same set of relations,
  and we can pull in examples directly from the database.

<p>We have also started adding more documentation to the development
  branch of our <a href="https://github.com/globalwordnet/OMW">new OMW interface</a>, but it has not been
  deployed yet: <a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/">here is a test server</a>.

  <h4>Related Material</h4>


<p>Link to the open source project that needs documentation:
  <a href='https://globalwordnet.github.io/gwadoc/'>GWADOC</a>,
  and some more documentation in the development
  branch of our <a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/omw/doc/wn">new OMW interface</a>.

<p>We have started with documentation for the core semantic relations,
  such as <a title="a word that is more general than a given word; animal is a
  hypernym of dog"
	     href="https://globalwordnet.github.io/gwadoc/#hypernym">hypernym</a>.
  The documentation needs to be fleshed
  out more, with descriptions of the meanings, linguistic tests, examples and more.

<p>Currently our documentation is both incomplete, inconsistent and
  overly technical when it exists.  It would also be good to have more
  links to the original documentation.

<p>Documentation on relations is spread over many sources, from the
  <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation">original man
  pages</a>,
  to <a href="https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/74100554/D041Final">project
  reports</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44288505_A_Wordnet_from_the_Ground_Up">books</a>
  and papers.

<p>We often add new information (like additional semantic relations),
  so it would be good to have a template for adding new relations.

<p>Finally (or perhaps initially), it would be good to have a
  documentation audit to see what information is missing.



<h4>Desired Skills</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Ability to read, write, and organize technical documentation
  <li> Fluent written and verbal communication skills in English
  <li> Some knowledge of linguistics
  <li> Good independent research and exploration skills
  <li> Familiarity with Git and HTML
</ul>
<h5> Nice to have: </h5>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">Project name: <a name="omw">The Open Multilingual Wordnet</a></h3>

<a href="http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/"> <!-- FIXME: old URL -->

<br>

<p style="margin-top:0.5em">The OMW is relatively complicated, and it would be good to have a
  couple of user guides.

<br> <br>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The Open Multilingual Wordnet provides access to open wordnets in a
  variety of languages, all linked to a collaborative Interlingual
  Index. The goal is to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple
  languages. The individual wordnets have been made by many different
  projects and vary greatly in size and accuracy. We have defined a
  common interchange format (GWA-LMF: Lexical markup framework) and a
  <a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/omw">website where
  people can upload and make new wordnets accessible</a>.  The Open
  Multilingual Wordnet and its components are open: they can be freely
  used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.

  <p>The wordnets are all developed independently, although
  all based on the original <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">Princeton Wordnet of English</a>.  They are
  also typically made in projects with finite funding windows, and not
  much money for maintenance.  Because of this, documentation is
  spread all over the world: as technical reports, academic papers,
  theses and more.

<h4>Related Material</h4>

  <p>Link to the open source project that needs documentation.
    <br> <a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/omw">Open
      Multilingual Wordnet Version 2.0</a>
 
    <p>These are some of the areas that we think need improvement.

  <h5>A guide for someone contributing a new wordnet (or family of wordnets)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li> How to make a well formatted wordnet
    <li> How to upload it
      <br>How to make sense of the feedback
  </ul>
<p><a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/join">Existing Documentation<a>
  
<h5>A guide for someone searching the wordnet (or family of wordnets)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li> How to read the returned pages
      <br> Synset, Sense, Summary, ...
    <li> How to download
    <li> How to provide feedback
  </ul>

<p>There is no existing documentation (we hope it is sort of intuitive, but
  suspect it may not be to outsiders).   Here are some examples.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/omw/concepts/57312">Search
    result for the concept <i>software documentation</i></a>
    <li><a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/omw/senses/97277">Search
	result for the sense <i>software documentation</i></a>
    <li><a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/omw/src/ellwn/1.0">Summary for the Greek Wordnet</a>
  </ul>

  
<h5>A guide for interacting with the Collaborative InterLingual Index (CILI)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li> Why and how to deprecate and supersede concepts
    <li> Judging new candidates
  </ul>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.luismc.com/omw/ili">documentation on CILI</a> in the developer branch on github.

<h3>Project Name: <a name="contrib">How to contribute to wordnet</a></h3>
<a href="https://en-word.net/"> <!-- FIXME: old URL -->
  <img src="pics/english.svg", style="height:10ex;float:left;padding-right: 10px">
</a>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">The goal is to let contributors know how to add new information
  (words, senses and synsets).  It would be good to have (i) a general
  guide and (ii) a guide specific to the English wordnet.

<br>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>We have a very rough guide at NTU:
  <a href="https://bond-lab.github.io/IMI/tagdoc.html#change">http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc/tagdoc.html</a>


<p>The Polish wordnet project and Eurowordnet also have extensive
  documentation, maybe not in English.

<h4>Requires:</h4>

<p>An illustrated step-by-step guides for:
<ul>
  <li> Adding a word to an existing synset
  <li> Adding a new concept
  <li> Deciding what should go into the wordnet and what stays out
  <li> Good form for definitions and examples
</ul>

<p>There will be a need for language specific extenstions, but we want
  to start by targeting English, specifically
  the <a href="https://en-word.net/">English Wordnet</a>.

<p><a href="https://github.com/globalwordnet/english-wordnet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Current Documentation</a>

<h4>Skills</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Fluent written and verbal communication skills in English
  <li> Ability to read, write, and organize technical documentation and user stories
  <li> Some knowledge of linguistics
