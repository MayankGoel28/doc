<h1>Global Wordnet Association Proposal for Google Season of Docs</h1>

<p>
The Global WordNet Association is a free, public and non-commercial
organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and
connecting wordnets for all languages in the world.  Our goal is to
make compatible, linked, open lexical resources useful for both humans
and computers.
</p>

<p>We are eager to welcome tech writing collaborators through the Google Season of Docs program to help us with our documentation needs! </p>

<h2>Ideas we invite tech writers to work with us on:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#structure">Wordnet Structure</a>
   meaning of relations, pos, etc: aimed more at layman, covering things from wordnets beyond PWN (based on PWN and OMW and ...)

<li>OMW how-tos
  
<li> <a href="#omw">How use the OMW</a>
  <ul>
  <li> Minimal required information
  <li> Desired information
  <li> Structure of definitions
</ul>

<li><a href="#contrib">How to contribute to a wordnet</a>

<li> Interface to wordnet (Python: based on NLTK), and/or IXA?
</ul>

<p>Almost all of these tasks should include a documentation audit, to
  see what we do and don't have already.

<p>Important to document that there are still some disagreements about some issues.  In this case we should try to add pointers to existing discussions. <!-- FIXME -->

<h3><a name="structure">Wordnet Structure</a></h3>

<a href='http://globalwordnet.org/'>
  <img src='pics/GWA_logo.png', style='height:10ex;float:left'>
</a>


<p>The goal is to make sure all the data-types (semantic relations,
  parts-of-speech, verb patterns, ...) are properly documented.  The
  goal is that both dictionary users and dictionary developers can
  access this easily, and we have a procedure for adding more
  documentation as needed.

  <br>  <br>
  
<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Documentation on relations is spread over many sources, from the
  <a href='https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation'>original man
  pages</a>,
  to <a href='https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/74100554/D041Final'>project
  reports</a>, <a href='http://www.plwordnet.pwr.wroc.pl/main/content/files/publications/A_Wordnet_from_the_Ground_Up.pdf'>books</a>
  and papers.  

<p>We have started to make a central repository of
  documentation: <a href="https://globalwordnet.github.io/gwadoc/">gwadoc</a>,
  but it needs a lot of work.  We are trying to keep UX strings together with the documentation,
  to make it easier to keep them in sync.
  
  
<h4>Needs</h4>

<p>We have started with documentation for the core semantic relations,
  such as <a title='a word that is more general than a given word; animal is a
  hypernym of dog'
	     href='https://globalwordnet.github.io/gwadoc/#hypernym'>hypernym</a>.
  The documentation needs to be fleshed
  out more, with descriptions meanings for tests, examples and more.

<p>Currently our documentation is both incomplete, inconsistent and
  overly technical when it exists.  It would also be good to have more
  links to the original documentation.

<p>We often add new information (like additional semantic relations),
  so it would be good to have a template for adding new relations.

<p>Finally (or perhaps initially), it would be good to have a
  documentation audit to see what information is missing.

<h3><a name="omw">OMW How-Tos</a></h3>
<a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/'> <!-- FIXME: old URL -->
  <img src='pics/omw-logo.svg', style='height:10ex;float:left'>
</a>

<p>The OMW is relatively complicated, and it would be good to have a
  couple of user guides.

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>FIXME

<h4>Needs</h4>

<p>A guide for someone contributing a new wordnet (or family of wordnets)
  <ul>
    <li> How to make a well formatted wordnet
    <li> How to upload it
      <br>How to make sense of the feedback
  </ul>

<p>A guide for someone searching the wordnet (or family of wordnets)
  <ul>
    <li> How to read the returned pages
      <br> Synset, Sense, Summary, ...
    <li> How to download
    <li> How to provide feedback
  </ul>
  
<p>A guide for interacting with the InterLingual Index
  <ul>
    <li> Why and how to deprecate and supersede
    <li> Judging new candidates
  </ul>

<h4>Mentors</h4>
  
Francis Bond, Arthur Bond, Luis?, Michael?

<h4>Skills</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Fluent written and verbal communication skills in English
  <li> Ability to read, write, and organize technical documentation and user stories
  <li> Some knowledge of linguistics 
  <li> Good independent research and exploration skills
</ul>
<p> Nice to have:
<ul>
  <li> Familiarity with Git
  <li> Experience with RST and Markdown
</ul>


<h3><a name="contrib">How to contribute to wordnet</a></h3>
<a href='https://en-word.net/'> <!-- FIXME: old URL -->
  <img src='pics/english.svg', style='height:10ex;float:left'>
</a>
<br> <p>The goal is to let contributors know how to add new information
  (words, senses and synsets).  It would be good to have (i) a general
  guide and (ii) a guide specific to the English wordnet. 


<h4>Background</h4>

<p>We have a guide at NTU:
  <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc/tagdoc.html'>http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc/tagdoc.html</a>
(and a better one down at the moment)  Christiane also gave me some
  notes (linked from the page that is down)

<p>I am sure plwordnet has lots, maybe not in English.

<h3>Wordnet APIs</h3>

<p>The goal is to document how to interface with the wordnet, through
  e.g. NLTK, IXA, or ...

<p><b>FIXME</b>I don't really want to do this for NLTK until we have
  upgraded to the OMW 2.0 interface, ...
